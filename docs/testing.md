# Testing and Performance

[简体中文](testing.zh-CN.md) | [Docs Index](README.md)

## Required Checks

```bash
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test ./... -count=1
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go vet ./...
gofmt -l .
git diff --check
```

## Focused Behavior Checks

Run focused tests while working on a small behavior change:

```bash
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test ./... -run 'TestName' -count=1
```

## Discovered Test Entry Points

This inventory is generated from the current `_test.go` files in this repository. It is intentionally complete so documentation review can catch stale test, benchmark, fuzz, and example coverage when code changes.

Total discovered entry points: 7.

### Tests (7)
- `TestDatagramEndpointSendReceive`
- `TestParseAddressAcceptsAbstractAddress`
- `TestParseAddressAcceptsPathAndUnixScheme`
- `TestParseAddressRejectsInvalidInput`
- `TestPeerCredentialsAndFDPassing`
- `TestUnixTransportEchoSmoke`
- `TestUnsupportedAdvancedUnixFeatures`

### Benchmarks (0)
- No Benchmark functions are currently declared.

### Fuzz Targets (0)
- No Fuzz targets are currently declared.

### Examples (0)
- No Example functions are currently declared.

## Race Checks

```bash
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test -race ./... -count=1
```

Race checks are most valuable for core, transport, handler, resolver, observability, examples, and benchmark modules. Platform-specific transports may require native host capabilities.

## Benchmarks

```bash
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test ./... -run '^$' -bench . -benchmem -benchtime=1s -count=5
```

Report `ns/op`, `B/op`, `allocs/op`, throughput, and p99 latency separately. Include host and OS details with every result.

## Pressure Testing

Pressure tests should run against a realistic assembled stack. Use `gnalloy.org/benchmarks` for repeatable matrices and `gnalloy.org/examples` for runnable clients. Keep warmup and measurement phases separate.

## CI

The repository validation workflow runs formatting, tests, and vet on Linux, macOS, and Windows for pushes and pull requests.

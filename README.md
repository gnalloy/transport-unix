# transport-unix

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [Documentation](docs/README.md)

Unix domain stream and datagram transport for Gnalloy, including Linux peer credentials and fd passing.

This module owns an I/O boundary. It creates or adapts Gnalloy Channels for a concrete transport while protocol parsing, business handlers, TLS policy, and observability remain in other modules.

## Module Boundary

This repository owns: Unix domain stream and datagram transport for Gnalloy, including Linux peer credentials and fd passing.

It does not absorb neighboring module responsibilities. Core primitives stay in `gnalloy.org/gnalloy`; protocol codecs, transports, handlers, resolvers, examples, and benchmarks stay in their own repositories.

## Packages
- `gnalloy.org/transport-unix` (`unix`)

## Gnalloy Dependencies
- `gnalloy.org/gnalloy`

## Common Integration Pattern
- Address, listener, dialer, buffer allocator, event loop, and channel initializer choices are part of the transport boundary.
- Platform-specific transports must return explicit unsupported errors rather than silently falling back.
- Privileged transports such as raw sockets and L2 capture need operating-system capabilities outside the Go module.
- Protocol, TLS, proxy, and observability handlers should be installed through the Channel pipeline.
- Unix-domain sockets are not available on every operating system, and credential or file-descriptor passing is platform-specific.

## Current Public Entry Points

The generated API reference lists the full public surface. Common constructors or option types currently include:
- `var ErrUnsupportedUnixSocket = errors.New("gnalloy/transport/unix: unsupported unix domain socket") ...`
- `type Config struct{ ... }`

## Verification

```bash
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test ./... -count=1
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go vet ./...
GOWORK=off GOTOOLCHAIN=local go test ./... -run '^$' -bench . -benchmem -count=1
```

For pressure tests, assemble this module with the relevant transport, codec, and handler stack and run the scenario from `gnalloy.org/benchmarks` or `gnalloy.org/examples`. Keep host, operating system, payload, concurrency, warmup, and repetitions in the report.

## Caveats
- This repository is intentionally narrow. Cross-module behavior should be assembled in applications, recipes, examples, or benchmark harnesses.
- Public APIs should remain Go-native and explicit; avoid runtime scanning, hidden global registries, and reflection-heavy behavior in hot paths.
- Treat network input as untrusted. Configure parser limits and return typed errors instead of panics.
- Keep benchmark claims tied to a concrete host, operating system, protocol, payload, concurrency, warmup, and repetition count.
- Transport modules do not parse application protocols by themselves; install the right codec and handler modules in the pipeline.
